attacks on cryptosystem
    -> cipher text only
    -> known plaintext
    -> chosen plaintext

cipher text only
    -> only the ciphertext is known
    -> only on simple algorithms
known plaintext
    -> could potentially be used on anything
    -> most effective on simple algorithms
    -> have ciphertext and plaintext, even if only portion, and analyze
chosen plaintext
    -> could potentially be used on anything
    -> works best on small data
    -> choose plaintext to try and achieve a known plaintext
        -> looking for key on a small number
